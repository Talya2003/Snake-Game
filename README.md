# Snake-Game
Computer game - guess.
The goal: to make the snake as big as possible.
the progress of the game:
At first the snake is small - one cube in total. Each time an apple appears on the screen in a different place. The player must "catch" the apple.
The more apples the snake "eats", the bigger it will grow.
pay attention! The snake must not touch beyond the edges of the screen as well as itself - this is called disqualification!
End of the game:
When the mouse reaches the prohibited area they are: beyond the edges of the screen and if it touches his body with his head.
